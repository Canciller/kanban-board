# Kanban board

I built a Kanban board using Vue.js and Nuxt.js as my first Vue project to compare it with React. Users can manage tasks across columns with features like creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Board data is saved to LocalStorage for seamless session persistence. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Vue and Nuxt.
